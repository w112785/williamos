just a little pet project for me.
I will be streaming/posting videos of this over on https://www.youtube.com/basiccomputerhelp/
Part one i mostly followed a modified version of this tutorial https://wiki.osdev.org/Bare_Bones
and I will also be using http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html
as well as other documents from https://wiki.osdev.org
